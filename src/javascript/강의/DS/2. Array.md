# Array

- An array is a data structure that can hold a collection of values

- Arrays can contain a mix of different data types. You can store strings, booleans, numbers or even objects all in the same array

- Arrays are `resizable`. You dont have to declare the size of an array before creating it.

- Javascript arrays are zero-indexed and the insertion order is maintained. (Javascript 배열은 색인화되지 않고 삽입 순서가 유지됩니다.)

- Arrays are iterables. They can be used with a for of loop.
